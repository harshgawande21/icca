## 🚀 **60-Second Pitch**

**"ICCA is a web application I developed to solve a real business problem - inconsistent and time-consuming email communication. 

The platform provides intelligent email composition with AI-like suggestions that detect tone, highlight missing information like pricing or deadlines, and recommend professional templates. I created 22 business email templates covering everything from proposals to customer support.

It's built with modern technologies - React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database - and includes secure user authentication, real-time suggestions, and mobile-responsive design. The entire application is deployed and costs $0/month using free hosting tiers.
